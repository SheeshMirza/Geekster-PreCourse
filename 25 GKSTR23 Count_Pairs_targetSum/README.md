### Problem
- Given an integer n & an integer target, the task is to find the number of pairs with sum equal to target in the range 1 to n (including) [1 - n].

### Note
- n is a positive integer

### Input Format
- Two lines of input
- An integer n, depicting the range from 1 to n(including)
- An integer target, depicting the value, for which you need to find & count the number pairs in the range 1 to n, whose sum is equal to target.

### Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 1000
- 0 <= target <= 1000

### Output Format
- Single line of output
- Count of pairs with sum equal to target in inclusive range of 1 to n.

```
Sample Input 0

6
5
Sample Output 0

2
Explanation 0

Since range is 1 to 6 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and target value is 5, therefore count of pairs with value 5 is 2 -> {1, 4} , {2, 3}
